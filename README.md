# **Fashion Item Generator using GANs**

## **1. Introduction**
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of deep learning models designed for generating synthetic data. In this project, we developed a GAN to generate realistic fashion items, inspired by the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of grayscale images of various clothing items such as shirts, shoes, and dresses.

## **2. Objectives**
- Develop a GAN model capable of generating realistic fashion images.
- Train the generator and discriminator using the Fashion MNIST dataset.
- Evaluate the model's performance in generating high-quality images.
- Optimize the training process using appropriate loss functions and optimizers.

## **3. Methodology**
### **3.1 Dataset**
We used the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of size 28x28 pixels. The dataset was preprocessed by normalizing the pixel values to the range [-1, 1].

### **3.2 Model Architecture**
#### **3.2.1 Generator Model**
The generator model was designed using a deep neural network to transform a random noise vector into a meaningful image. It consists of:
- A fully connected layer to reshape input noise.
- Three transposed convolution layers with ReLU activation.
- A final convolution layer with Tanh activation to generate the output image.

#### **3.2.2 Discriminator Model**
The discriminator is a binary classifier that distinguishes between real and fake images. It consists of:
- A fully connected layer to flatten input images.
- Two dense layers with ReLU activation.
- A final output layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification.

### **3.3 Training Process**
- The generator takes a random noise vector and generates an image.
- The discriminator is trained to classify real images (from the dataset) and fake images (from the generator).
- Loss functions used:
  - **Binary Cross-Entropy Loss** for the discriminator.
  - **Binary Cross-Entropy Loss** for the generator (to encourage realistic image generation).
- Both models are optimized using the **Adam optimizer** with a learning rate of 1e-4.

### **3.4 Training Implementation**
- The training was performed for **50 epochs** with a batch size of 128.
- At every epoch, the generator and discriminator were updated using gradient descent.
- Periodic visualization of generated images was done to track the modelâ€™s performance.

## **4. Results and Discussion**
- The generator improved significantly over epochs, producing visually realistic fashion items.
- The discriminator effectively distinguished between real and fake images, stabilizing after initial fluctuations.
- The loss trends showed convergence, indicating a balanced GAN training.
- Sample images generated after training showed clear details and patterns resembling real fashion items.

## **5. Conclusion and Future Work**
This project demonstrated the effectiveness of GANs in generating synthetic fashion images. The model successfully learned patterns from the dataset and produced visually appealing results. Future improvements include:
- Training on higher-resolution datasets.
- Using advanced GAN architectures like DCGAN or StyleGAN.
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters to enhance image diversity and realism.
